# Getting going with Java

1.  Launch Eclipse
1.  Select File > Open Projects From Filesystem ...
1.  Click "Directory" and browse to one of the projects in this folder (e.g. Team3543Robot)
1.  Make sure it is selected and click OK

## RobotBuilder

If you are going to use RobotBuilder, you can launch it from Eclipse under the WPILib menu.  Open the "Team3543Robot.yaml" to edit the robot for the Team3543Robot generated code.  

### How to use it

Pretty easy, see [this doc](http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/26402) for detailed steps:

*  use the GUI to make changes to subsystems, commands, etc.
*  File > Save to save changes to the YAML file
*  Click "Java" on the toolbar to update your Java code.

Tips:

*  *Pay attention* to the "AUTOGENERATED* sections in the code and don't put your own code in there - it will get erased next time you re-generate from RobotBuilder!
