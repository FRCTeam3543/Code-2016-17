This contains commands we messed around with but never ended up using.  
Code is preserved here for posterity, but be warned that it probably didn't work right.

We were trying to use path planners from the cheesy poofs and https://github.com/KHEngineering/SmoothPathPlanner but never quite got them
working.  We ended up having more success with shorter-range feedback control and vision.

Motion profile code from CTRE is adapted here.  See https://github.com/CrossTheRoadElec/FRC-Examples/blob/master/JAVA_MotionProfileExample/src/org/usfirst/frc/team3539/robot/MotionProfileExample.java

The interfaces are maintained here so that we can get a head start next year.
